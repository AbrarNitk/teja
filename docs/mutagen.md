## An Overview
Mutagen is dev utility that lets you use your existing local tools to working remote machine like 
cloud servers and containers.It does this by providing high-performance file synchronization and 
flexible network forwarding, allowing you to develop applications in a way that looks local but runs
on remote hardware. It works directly between your local system, and the remote infrastructure that
you need to access.

## File synchronization
Mutagen's file synchronization is designed to facilitate real-time code editing with your existing
code editor orIDE, allowing you to quickly test code changes in a remote machine without having to 
re-deploy it. It has rsync-like performance,coupled with low-latency filesystem watching and the 
ability to operate in both unidirectional and bidirectional modes.It gives users granular control
over behaviours like conflict resolution, ignores, symbolic link handling, permission propagation, 
and more. It's also aggressively cross-platform,meaning that platform-specific are handled 
automatically and Windows-to-POSIX development is not a problem.
